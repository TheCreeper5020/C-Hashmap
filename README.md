# C Hashmap
## Brief Description
This library implements a simple, type-generic hashmap in C. It is almost certainly not the best implementation, and I mostly created it for my own personal usage, but feel free to use it in whatever you make.
## How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. Copy the src/hashmap.h and src/hashmap.c into your own project
3. Add src/hashmap.c to your compile list.
I may decide to make a makefile later if more than 5 people use it lol
