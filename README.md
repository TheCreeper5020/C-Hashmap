# C Hashmap
## Brief Description
This library implements a simple, type-generic hashmap in C. It is almost certainly not the best implementation, and I mostly created it for my own personal usage, but feel free to use it in whatever you make.
## How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `make` to compile it and place the build into build/libhashmap.so, or `make static` for a static version.
3. Link against it in your own project by adding it to your library directory and using `-lhashmap`.
